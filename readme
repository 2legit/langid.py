langid.py is a standalone Language Identification (LangID) tool.

The design principles are as follows:

1) Fast
2) Pre-trained over a large number of languages (currently 97)
3) Not sensitive to domain-specific features (e.g. HTML/XML markup)
3) Single .py file with minimal dependencies
4) Deployable as a web service

Currently, all that is required to run langid.py is >= Python 2.5 and numpy. 

langid.py comes pre-trained on 97 languages (ISO 639-1 codes given):

  af, am, an, ar, as, az, be, bg, bn, br, 
  bs, ca, cs, cy, da, de, dz, el, en, eo, 
  es, et, eu, fa, fi, fo, fr, ga, gl, gu, 
  he, hi, hr, ht, hu, hy, id, is, it, ja, 
  jv, ka, kk, km, kn, ko, ku, ky, la, lb, 
  lo, lt, lv, mg, mk, ml, mn, mr, ms, mt, 
  nb, ne, nl, nn, no, oc, or, pa, pl, ps, 
  pt, qu, ro, ru, rw, se, si, sk, sl, sq, 
  sr, sv, sw, ta, te, th, tl, tr, ug, uk, 
  ur, vi, vo, wa, xh, zh, zu

The training data was drawn from 5 different sources:
  JRC-Acquis 
  ClueWeb 09
  Wikipedia
  Reuters RCV2
  Debian i18n

langid.py is WSGI-compliant. 

langid.py will use fapws3 as a web server if available, and default to
wdgiref.simple_server otherwise.
