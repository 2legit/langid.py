This branch contains work on porting langid.py to Python3.

The main langid.py was ported with 2to3. This was smooth
for the most part, except for a problem with the model.
The issue was that numpy data structures pickled in Python 2
did not unpickle properly in Python 3. This was resolved
by using exclusively Python native data structures for the
model. The parameters of the model are unchanged between
the Python2 and Python3 versions, only the concrete data
structures used.

TODO:
1) Create a version compatible with both Python2 and Python3.
2) Port the training tools.
